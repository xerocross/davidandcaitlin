David was in a small room, and the girl was crying.  She looked about six years old with pale blond hair.  She was stooped over a woman.  The woman lay dead on the floor in a pool of her on blood, her throat slit, her eyes wide and staring.  The woman looked like the girl---her mother.  The woman had long, straight hair that appeared to be graying prematurely, but the effect was not unattractive.  In life no doubt the woman had been beautiful, just as her daughter would be beautiful.  Now the hair lay under her head as if she had been carefully arranged in death.

David woke suddenly, clammy and confused.  He checked his alarm clock.  The hands of the analog dial read 12:42.  It was just after midnight then.  The house was quiet, his room dark.

He fumbled in the dark near the foot of his bed for the pajama pants he had been wearing, and he put them back on before going out as quietly as he could, without disturbing the dust, without turning on any of the lights.  His roommates would be home now and sleeping.  David did not want to invite scrutiny.

Past the kitchen and carefully, silently opening the back door.  He pushed the door closed behind him to just a crack, and he sat again on the folding chair and cast his glance over the ashtray and the marijuana pipe Nick had left out here without a care in the world.

Finally he brought himself to look at the rotting strawberries.  The air was too cold on his bare chest, but he didn't care.  He thought of pouring himself another finger or two of scotch.  Finally, he gathered the straberries and the orange peels up in his hands and tossed them into the yard, into the night.
