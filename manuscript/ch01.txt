# A Girl Named Charlie

It was a cool, dewy morning just before twilight when David arrived home from work and locked his bike to a tree in the front yard. He worked nights, and he made just over minimum wage.  He was pleased he could afford to live here---an unremarkable house, but it was in a nice part of town.  He shared the place with two roommates, but even so.  There were plenty of trees, and he often saw deer running around freely at this time of day.  And it was only biking distance to the center of town.

Riding his bicycle to and from work was an attempt at fitness.  Also it was bracing in the morning chill.  And somehow the loneliness of it felt right to him.  There was something deeply lonely about biking in the morning before dawn.  It wasn't the same as driving.  Driving could be lonely too, especially driving on a highway at night.  But it was different.

He was careful to open the front door quietly.  His roommates would still be asleep.  They both had day jobs.

He kicked off his shoes just inside the door, went to the kitchen for a clean old fashioned style glass and then to his bedroom where he poured himself two fingers of scotch and sat for a moment on his bed, drink in hand.

He pushed his socks off one foot at a time with his toes and then brought his feet up to sit cross-legged.  He had no plans but to sip scotch in bed until sleep took him.  Then wake up, go to work, come back home and repeat.  *Much as almost everyone lives their lives,* he thought.  *One pointless day after another.*

His roommate's dog Barney came sniffing around his doorway, asking if he could come inside in his own dog-like way.  Dogs were welcome sometimes.  Nobody else was.  If David wanted company, he went out.

Barney was a mutt.  He was medium sized and friendly and submissive.  Sometimes David would take care of him when Nick was out of town.  David and his roommates were friendly in an arms-length, businesslike sort of way.  Even if David had had no particular reason for keeping secrets, he did not like to tell people about his personal affairs.

Both roommates were in their late 20s.  David was 30 years old.  They knew him as Johnathan.  He received mail here as Johnathan.  And David always tried to act stupider when they were around.  But the ruse fell short of hiding all his books.  The walls of his bedroom were covered full and overflowing with books.  He never invited anyone inside his room, but every time the door was open anyone could see that it looked like a messy library.  All the free wall space was covered by bookcases, and every bookcase was stuffed extra full of books.  Every flat surface in the room was covered in dirty glasses and soda cans and books that had been opened and stacked.

Without ever saying it exactly, David encouraged them to think that his books were all novels and that he was a struggling unpublished novelist himself.

The scotch was cheaper than what he had grown used to in his earlier life.  But if things had not gone the way they did, he might not have started leaning so heavily on the scotch in the first place.  It had an unpleasant bite.  He added more water to it than he would have used with good scotch.

He sat and sipped, and Barney sat on the floor by his bed, content for just a moment.  But Barney was not content for long.  He stood up and he started walking toward the door, and then he came back for David.  Then he turn and went again---clearly asking David to follow him the way dogs do.  Barney did this several times, dancing a little as he walked.  David figured he needed to be let outside.

He took the scotch with him to let Barney out the back door.  As soon as David stood up, Barney raced into the living room and then waited.  Then when David got to the living room, Barney raced to the back door.  

Barney didn't bark.  He was not impolite to his sleeping human, Nick.  Nor to his other sleeping human friend Alex.  Alex was the other roommate, and Alex had a dog too.  Alex and his dog were presumably both in their room sleeping.

As soon as David opened the back door, Barney raced out and became a shadow moving joyfully among the grass and bushes of the yard before he settled to do his business.

David sat on a folding chair on the back stoop and waited.  And he sipped his scotch slowly.  After a moment, he noticed tiny fruit flies buzzing around a potted plant beside the door, and suddenly he realized he could smell it.

The smell was rotting fruit. Sweet and foul at the same time. There on top of the soil in the pot someone had tossed two handfuls of strawberries and left them to rot along with bits of orange peel.

*It's a message*, he thought.  The thought was instantaneous, as soon as he saw the strawberries.  He knew immediately who had put them there, and he knew what the message meant, but it all still seemed absurd to him.  Surely Alex has just thrown some compost here to help fertilize the plant.

*But the fact that I saw it immediately as a message means most likely it is a message*, he thought.  She would know how to send him a cryptic message that only he would understand.

It had been long enough, so David called Barney back.  The dog hesitated just a moment and then he came running back and he waited by the door, wagging his tail.

David decided to leave the strawberries where they were.  Each roommate would just think one of the others had put them there.

Inside, Barney went quietly back into Nick's room.  David poured a tall glass of water in the kitchen and then retired for the day to his bedroom.  He closed the door behind him, changed into pajama pants, and sat on his bed again.

The walls of his bedroom were covered mostly with books of physics and some smaller collections in the other sciences.  On a shelf within reaching distance of his bed was a collection of self-help books that looked well worn.

He pulled a book from the self-help shelf without looking at it.  But he didn't open the book. He just sat and sipped his scotch, his eyes glazed with a thousand-yard stare.

The book's cover was *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. But that was just the cover. David had carefully cut the cover off a copy of that book and replaced the inside with an obscure book he treasured---*Topology of Symbolic Similarity and Resonance*. The author himself had often just called the book and its subject "*Symbolic Similarity Magic*", so that is how David thought of it. The old professor was a friend, and he had been David's dissertation advisor years ago when David was earning his PhD.

*She's here, and she wants to meet*, he thought. He just had to get the roommates out of the house for a while. She would be watching. She would know that was an invitation.
