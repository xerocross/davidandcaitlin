David slept dreamlessly at first and then more fitfully as the hours wore on.  By the time he woke again it was 5 PM and he had decided to call in sick for work.

For the price of two movie tickets, Nick and Alex agreed to let him have the house to himself for the night---at least until midnight.  He didn't offer them any details, but he used certain phrases to suggest he wanted privacy for a date.  It was more or less the truth anyway.

She would see in her way, however it was she always seemed to know things

When both roommates had gone, David began to tidy his bedroom.  Then he put some clothes in the washer.  Then he poured a drink, sat, and waited. Minutes passed in nervous anticipation.  At this point in his life, one drink was far too little to calm his nerves.

He wondered suddenly if he was presentable enough, and he glanced down at himself. His jeans were over-worn. Quickly to the bathroom mirror.  Blond. Thin. No obvious attempt at muscles or fitness.  He wet his fingers and ran them through his hair.  This was about as good as it was going to get.  

He was interrupted by a quiet knock at the front door. He went at a run in his bare feet. Opened the door. It was her, and the two of them just stood for a moment. She had dyed her hair. Or was that a wig? It was much darker than the sandy blond he remembered. And it was shorter---just below the chin. And she wore glasses with a thick black plastic frame. The effect was drastic. She looked like a different person almost. But nothing she could do would change the shape of her face, and she still wore thick black mascara to emphasize her already large eyes.

"You look changed," she said.  "Your face is the same, but you look like the kind of tired that doesn't go away with sleep."

"You mean I look older?" he suggested.

She smiled.  "No.  You still look 25."

"Well," he said. "You look better as a blond."

"I know," she said.

"Come in.  Have a seat," he offered.

She lingered just a moment by the door as if unsure what to do.

"This isn't just a social call," she said.

"I know that, Darling. I'm not an idiot. Any chance you'll take that thing off?" He glanced up at the wig.

She shrugged. "It's hard to put back on right. We'll see. Can I have one of whatever you're drinking?" She paused briefly. "Scotch, is it? Ugh. Beer please if you have it."

He chuckled. "I have beer."

She sat on the sofa while he went to the kitchen for beer.

She wore a too-big, off-one-shoulder blouse that looked like it came straight from the 80s. When he returned from the kitchen with two beers, his eyes lingered on the cream of her exposed shoulder.

"Shouldn't you avoid the attention?" he said.

She followed his gaze. "A man looking at my shoulder isn't looking at my face very hard," she said. She took the beer and the glass he offered. She put the glass down and drank the beer from the bottle.

He sat next to her on the sofa, on her left side, his thigh against hers, and he could think of little else but running his fingers through her hair again---her real hair.  A wig just wouldn't do.

"What do they call you these days," he asked.

She smiled, then laughed, and he didn't know what was funny, but he was thrilled to hear her laugh.

"I'm going by Charlie---Charlotte on documents. 'But don't call me Charlotte,' I tell people. I practiced my signature so many times."

She put her hand softly on his thigh near the knee. "Do you know why I'm here?" she said.

"To see my handsome face, of course," he said.

"Yes, that," she said with no irony at all. "But there's more."

"That much I presume."

"When you presume, you make a 'pres' out of you and me," she said.

"I'm willing to take that risk," he said.

She turned to look at him pointedly. Her eyes always had so much to say. There was worry there, and there was mirth and affection.

"You are still allowed to kiss me, David," she said.  "You always were. Just do it already because I have something I need to tell you and I want your full attention on what I'm say-ing."

He reached gingerly for her face and touched the black plastic glasses she wore. "Do you actually need these?"

"No. They're plain glass."

He took them off her and put them on the table. He began trying to remove the wig and he fumbled at it. Evidently she had it pinned down or something. She sighed with limitless patience, and she reached up with both hands to unfasten it herself. She tossed the wig aside and then untied her natural hair. It fell down to her shoulders in spirals the color of beach sand on a summer day in full sunlight.

When he moved in to kiss her lips, she pushed in and she bit his bottom lip and grabbed the back of his head, tightly grasping a handful of his hair.
She pulled back just a moment to meet his eyes again, smiling. "I know you think I'm some beautiful goddess and I'm out of your league or something---"

"Quit doing that," he cut in.

&ldquo;---But you are quite a catch yourself," she finished.

He had nothing to say to that.  He knew this thing she was doing all too well, and he meant to let her finish, but mostly he was fascinated by touching her left ear.

"For example," she continued. "Your eyes are the greenest I've ever seen. And I do not talk too much!"

"Darling girl, would you please let me say a thing before you respond angrily to it? I'd like you to know that I had the balls to say it out loud."

She cocked her head, waiting, smiling.

"Darling girl, you talk too much. You offered me a kiss and I mean to take it."

She kissed him then, and it was firm, and it felt very much like she was the one doing the kissing, but she pulled away too soon. With a touch of worry in her eyes suddenly, she reached for her purse and pulled out a piece of copy paper folded twice. She pushed it to his chest without looking. "Tell me what you see," she said.

Somehow he knew instantly what that paper was.  It was a sketch of a woman's face done in pencil.  Rather, it was a photocopy of the original.  Caitlin had made it for the police.  She had seen a woman's face the night this all started, and she had tried to put the police on the right track. *The pigs got it all so wrong though,* he thought.

When he unfolded the paper and looked, he was confused. "I thought you were showing me the old sketch from when&hellip; But this is&hellip;" He paused, hoping she would explain, but she just waited. 

"Is this Penelope Walters?" he said.
